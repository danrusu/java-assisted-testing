# Java assisted testing

***

*I consider time to be the most valuable resource in our life.*

***

*For me, automation scope is to buy time.*
That means, my entire career,
I've tried to design tools that buy time.

The first development language I fell in love with, eight years ago, is **Java**.
It helped me automate different processes, especially on the testing side.

I will try to emphasize a few practices and tools that will make a difference in the long term.

Automation tools only assist us in our attempt to buy time,
we should always *focus on the problem we try to solve*, and the patterns we encounter.

# Roadmap

***

### 1. Generic concepts
  
- **IT career** 
   
  - professionalism 
    
  - continuous learning 
      
  - adaptability  

  - divide and conquer
    

- **Buying time** - *Automation* is about using information technology 
    or machines to handle repetitive processes and tasks, 
    while *freeing humans to do other things*.


- **Jack of all trades ...**

***

### 2. Java assisted testing

`Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding.` *- Burt Rutan -*
 
***

#### 2.1 Hints

- focus on the goal, add value


- use the IDE as much as possible for static automation


- [clean code](./resource/clean_code.JPG)
  - naming
    
    `There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.` *- Phil Karlton -*
  - KISS
  - DRY


- standardize test input (scenarios) and output (reports)
  - choose programmatically interpretable formats (i.e. JSON or XML) 

#### 2.2 Tools and libraries

- *IDE* - [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)


- *unit test framework*
  - [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/)
  - [Junit5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)


- *mocking* - [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/)
    

- *UI test* - [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)


- *API test* - [RestAssured](https://rest-assured.io/) 


- *fluent assertions* - [AssertJ](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/)
